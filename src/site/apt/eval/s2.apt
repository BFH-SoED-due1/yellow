Deliverable 2

* Introduction

	This document describes the tasks to be performed for, and the constituents
of the Deliverable 2. Such a document would usually not exist in a real
project documentation. (Similar information would be found elsewhere, for
example, in the Sprint Plan document, however.)

		[Note:]	Do not edit or modify this document. This document is
				managed by your lecturer.


* Goals

	The goals for this sprint are:

	*	To learn how to initiate a sprint.

	*	To organize a sprint in terms of product backlog, sprint backlog/tasks

			*	Product backlog organization

			*	Tasks and task allocations.

			*	Team collaboration.

			*	Working with Git (branches, team efforts, merging, ...)

	*	To deliver tested code.

* Your Tasks

	These are the effective task you'll have to provide for this sprint:

	*	Organize your product backlog (PL):

			* PL item prioritization

			* PL item grooming

			* PL item "best-guess" estimation

	*	Organize your sprint
	
			* Fix the list of PB items for this sprint

			* Split larger PB items into tasks

			* Provide task "best-guess" estimations

	*	Update any documents you have so far, if needed

	*	Provide code for selected user stories (or parts thereof)

			* Packages according your (initial) architecture

			* Production Java interfaces and classes

			* JUnit test classes

	[]


* Components of this Deliverable

	The deliverable for this sprint shall encompass:

	*	The product backlog at the beginning of the sprint

	*	The sprint backlog items / task list
	
	*	The list of finished sprint backlog items / tasks

	*	Production Java interfaces and classes

	*	JUnit test classes, coverage: 95% (UI components excluded)

	*	Check the Checkstyle report.

	[]



* Evaluation

	50 points at most per team member are attributed to this deliverable. Points may
	not be equally distributed among team members. (However, this is the goal.)
